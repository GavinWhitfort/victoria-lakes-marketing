# Facebook Group Posts - Victorian Boaters/Fishers

## Post 1: Boating Groups (Casual, Problem-Solving)

🌊 Victorian boaters - I made this for us!

Got sick of checking clunky government websites before heading to Eildon, so I built an iPhone widget that shows:

✅ Live water levels for 22 Victorian lakes
✅ Weekly trends (rising/falling)
✅ Right on your home screen

No more guessing if there's enough water before you tow the boat 2 hours!

[Attach video]

Supports: Eildon, Hume, Mulwala, Nagambie, Buffalo, Dartmouth, Eppalock, Yarrawonga + 14 more.

## Post 2: Fishing Groups (Fishing-Focused Benefits)

🎣 Vic fishers - built a widget that tracks lake levels + weekly changes

Why it matters: When water is rising/falling, fish behavior changes. This shows:

📊 Current water level (%)
📈 Weekly change (+/- %)
🌊 Total volume (ML)

Right on your iPhone home screen - no more opening websites.

22 Victorian lakes supported: Eildon, Hume, Mulwala, Nagambie, Buffalo, Dartmouth, Eppalock, and more.

Perfect for planning trips around water movement.

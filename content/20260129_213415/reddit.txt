Title: I built a Scriptable widget for Victorian lake water levels (Eildon, Mulwala, Nagambie, etc.)

Body:
Victorian boaters/fishers - built this for us.

I was tired of:
- Opening 5 different websites to check lake levels
- Guessing if the water was high enough
- Driving 2 hours only to find low water

So I built a Scriptable widget that solves all of this.

**Features:**
- Real-time data for 22 Victorian lakes
- Weekly trends (is it rising or falling?)
- Glanceable on your home screen
- Small, medium, and large widgets

**Supported lakes:** Eildon, Mulwala, Nagambie, Buffalo, Hume, Dartmouth, Eppalock, Yarrawonga, and more.

Title: I built a Scriptable widget for Victorian lake water levels (Eildon, Mulwala, Nagambie, etc.)

Body:
Got sick of checking multiple government websites before heading to Lake Eildon, so I built a Scriptable widget that shows:

• Live water levels (% full)
• Weekly change indicators (rising/falling)
• Total volume in megalitres
• Support for 22 Victorian lakes

Works on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Three widget sizes available.

Perfect for boaters, fishers, and campers who want to know conditions before the trip.

Lakes supported: Eildon, Hume, Mulwala, Nagambie, Buffalo, Dartmouth, Eppalock, and more.

Feedback welcome! What other features would be useful?

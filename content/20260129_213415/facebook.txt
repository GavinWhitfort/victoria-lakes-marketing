Just launched a new iPhone widget that shows LIVE water levels for 22 Victorian lakes.

Never guess lake conditions again. Weekly trends show if it's rising or falling.

Who else checks lake levels before heading out? 🙋‍♂️

I got sick of opening clunky websites, so I built an iPhone widget that shows:
• Live water levels
• Weekly change indicators  
• 22 Victorian lakes

Eildon | Mulwala | Nagambie | Buffalo | Hume | Eppalock | and more

Game changer for planning boating and fishing trips!

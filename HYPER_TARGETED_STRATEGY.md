# Hyper-Targeted Marketing Strategy
## Focus: Victorian Boaters, Fishers, Campers ONLY

**Problem with Reddit/SideProject:** Global tech nerds, not your buyers.

**Solution:** Go where Victorian boaters/fishers actually hang out.

---

## 🎯 Channel 1: Facebook Groups (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

### Why Facebook?
- Victorian locals actually use it
- Boating/fishing groups are HUGE and active
- Way more tolerant of products
- Older demographic = disposable income = higher conversion

### Target Groups (Post Today):

**Boating:**
- "Boating Victoria" (5K+ members)
- "Lake Eildon Boating" (if it exists)
- "Houseboat Owners Australia" 
- "Jet Ski Owners Victoria"
- "Wake Boarding Victoria"

**Fishing:**
- "Fishing Victoria" (20K+ members) ⭐ HUGE
- "Lake Eildon Fishing Reports"
- "Murray Cod Fishing Australia"
- "Bass Fishing Victoria"

**Camping:**
- "Camping Victoria"
- "4WD & Camping Victoria"
- "Caravan & Camping Victoria"

**Local:**
- "Lake Eildon Community"
- "Nagambie Community"
- "Yarrawonga Community"

### Facebook Post Template:

```
🌊 Victorian boaters/fishers - I made this for us!

I got sick of checking clunky government websites before heading to Eildon, so I built an iPhone widget that shows:

✅ Live water levels for 22 Victorian lakes
✅ Weekly trends (rising/falling)
✅ Right on your home screen

No more guessing if there's enough water before you tow the boat 2 hours!

[Attach your video]

Supports: Eildon, Hume, Mulwala, Nagambie, Buffalo, Dartmouth, Eppalock, Yarrawonga + more.

Grab it here: https://dgtlgav.gumroad.com

What other lakes should I add?
```

**Post once per day to different groups.** Don't spam same group.

## 📱 Channel 3: TikTok/Instagram (Victorian Targeting)

### Why This Works:
- Geo-target Victorian users with hashtags
- Viral potential in niche communities
- Visual = perfect for widget demo

### Hashtag Strategy (Victorian-Specific):

**Location tags:**
- #LakeEildon #Nagambie #Mulwala #Yarrawonga
- #VictorianLakes #VisitVictoria

**Activity tags:**

### Post Schedule:
- **3x per week** on TikTok
- **5x per week** on Instagram
- Use generated content from earlier

**Key:** Tag location + activity. Algorithm will show to Victorians interested in boating/fishing.

## 🤖 Channel 4: The Reddit Bot (Still Valid!)

### Why It Works:
The bot finds people ASKING about Victorian lakes:
- "Anyone know Lake Eildon levels?"
- "Heading to Nagambie this weekend, water good?"
- "Best lakes for fishing this month?"

**These are HOT LEADS** because they're:
1. Victorian (your target)
2. Actively planning trips (buying intent)
3. Asking for solutions (your widget)

**Bot replies naturally:**
> "I actually built a widget for this! Shows Eildon at 52.9% right now, down -0.68% this week. Live data for 22 Vic lakes: [link]"

**This is gold.** Keep the bot running.

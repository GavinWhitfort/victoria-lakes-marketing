**Title:** I made a Victorian lakes water level widget for Scriptable (22 lakes supported)

Hey everyone! Built a Scriptable widget for Victorian lake water levels that I thought might be useful for other boaters/fishers/campers.

**Features:**
- Live water levels for 22 Victorian lakes
- Weekly change indicators (rising/falling %)
- Three sizes (small, medium, large)
- Clean visual design with wave patterns
- Total volume in megalitres

**Supported lakes:** Eildon, Hume, Mulwala, Nagambie, Buffalo, Dartmouth, Eppalock, Yarrawonga, and more.

[Video attached showing Lake Eildon at 52.9%, Lake Mulwala at 96.3%, Lake Nagambie at 97.9%]

I got sick of checking clunky government websites before heading out, so I built this. Glanceable data right on the home screen.

## Post 3: r/melbourne (Casual, local)

**Title:** Made an iPhone widget for Victorian lake levels (Eildon, Mulwala, Nagambie, etc.)

**Body:**
Fellow Victorian boaters/fishers - built this for us.

I was tired of:
- Opening 5 different government websites to check lake levels
- Guessing if the water was high enough
- Driving 2 hours to Eildon only to find disappointing water

So I made a Scriptable widget that shows live levels + weekly trends for 22 Victorian lakes.

[Video showing Lake Eildon 52.9%, Mulwala 96.3%, Nagambie 97.9%]

Works on iPhone, iPad, Mac. Small, medium, and large widgets.

**Lakes supported:** Eildon, Hume, Mulwala, Nagambie, Buffalo, Dartmouth, Eppalock, Yarrawonga, Goulburn Weir, Lake Charm, Tullaroop, and more.

Let me know what you think or if there's other lakes you'd want added!

## Post 4: r/AusFishing (Fishing-focused)

**Title:** Lake level widget for Victorian fishers - tracks weekly rises/falls

**Body:**
Built an iPhone widget for checking lake levels before fishing trips.

The key feature for fishers: **weekly change indicators**

When water is rising/falling, fish behavior changes. This widget shows:
- Current water level (%)
- Weekly change (+/- %)
- Total volume (ML)
- 22 Victorian lakes supported

[Video showing Eildon down -0.68%, Mulwala down -1.36%, Nagambie down -1.05%]

Perfect for planning trips around water movement. No more checking multiple websites.

**Supported lakes:** Eildon, Hume, Mulwala, Nagambie, Buffalo, Dartmouth, Eppalock, plus 15 more.

Would love feedback from other Victorian fishers!

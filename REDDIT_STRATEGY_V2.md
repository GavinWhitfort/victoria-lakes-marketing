# Reddit Strategy V2 - After Removal

## Why It Was Removed

**Common reasons:**
1. **Self-promotion** - Direct link to paid product triggers spam filters
2. **New account / low karma** - Subreddits require established users
3. **No community participation** - You need to contribute before promoting
4. **Gumroad link** - Seen as commercial spam

## The Right Way to Reddit

### Phase 1: Build Community Trust (Week 1)

**Before promoting anything:**
1. **Comment on 10-20 posts** in r/Scriptable, r/melbourne, r/iOSsetups
   - Give helpful widget advice
   - Share tips
   - Answer questions
   - Be genuinely useful

2. **Post something free/helpful first:**
   - "What widgets do Victorian's use?"
   - "Best Scriptable widgets for local data?"
   - Share a tip or tutorial (not your product)

3. **Build karma** (aim for 50-100 karma before promoting)

### Phase 2: Soft Launch (Week 2)

**Post WITHOUT the Gumroad link:**

**Title:** "Made a Victorian lakes water level widget - feedback welcome"

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone! Built a Scriptable widget for Victorian lake water levels. Would love feedback before I finalize it.

**Features:**
- Live water levels for 22 Victorian lakes
- Weekly change indicators (rising/falling %)
- Three sizes (small, medium, large)
- Wave pattern visualization

[Video attached]

**Supported lakes:** Eildon, Hume, Mulwala, Nagambie, Buffalo, Dartmouth, Eppalock, Yarrawonga, etc.

What features would make this more useful? Any other lakes worth adding?

(Happy to share the code if anyone's interested)
```

**Key changes:**
- ❌ No Gumroad link
- ✅ Ask for feedback (not sales)
- ✅ Offer to share code
- ✅ Community-focused language

### Phase 3: Respond to Interest (Same Day)

**When people ask "where can I get this?":**

Reply naturally:
> "Thanks! I put it up here: https://dgtlgav.gumroad.com (small price to cover dev time). Happy to help with setup if you grab it!"

**This works because:**
- People ASKED for the link
- You're responding, not spamming
- It's helpful, not pushy

## Alternative Subreddit Strategy

### Post to These Instead (More Lenient):

**r/SideProject** - Made for showcasing projects
- Title: "Built an iPhone widget for Victorian lake levels"
- They WELCOME product posts with links
- Link allowed: ✅

**r/somethingimade** - Show off your creations
- Very supportive community
- Links encouraged
- Good engagement

**r/EntrepreneurRideAlong** - For makers building products
- Explicitly allows product posts
- Great feedback community

**r/indiehackers** - Indie makers community
- Product launches welcome
- Links allowed

---

## Better Approach: Split the Content

### Post 1: Show Off (No Link)
Post the video to r/Scriptable, r/melbourne with:
- "Made this widget, what do you think?"
- No sales pitch
- Pure showcase

### Post 2: GitHub (Free Version)
Create a basic FREE version on GitHub:
- Basic functionality
- Links to premium version in README
- Post to r/Scriptable: "Open source lake widget"

This builds trust + drives sales.

## Immediate Action Plan

### Option A: Try These Subreddits NOW (Link-Friendly)

1. **r/SideProject** ✅ Post now with Gumroad link
2. **r/somethingimade** ✅ Post now
3. **r/australianprojects** ✅ If it exists
4. **r/iOSProgramming** ⚠️ Technical audience only

### Option B: Build Trust First (Better Long-Term)

**Next 3 days:**
1. Comment on 20 posts in r/Scriptable helping people
2. Post a "What widgets do you use?" discussion in r/melbourne
3. Share a free tip/tutorial in r/iOSsetups

**Day 4:**
Post your widget (no link) asking for feedback

**Day 5:**
When people ask, share link in comments

---

## The Bot Strategy (Still Valid)

The **Reddit monitor bot** is PERFECT for this situation because:
- ✅ It responds to existing conversations (not spam)
- ✅ Provides helpful answers
- ✅ Only comments when relevant
- ✅ Natural, not pushy

**This is the better long-term play.**

## Quick Win: Post in Link-Friendly Subs

Want me to create posts for r/SideProject and r/somethingimade right now? Those communities WANT product posts.

Or should we:
1. Build community karma first (slower, more trust)
2. Focus on automated bot responses instead
3. Try Facebook groups (way more lenient)

What do you want to do?

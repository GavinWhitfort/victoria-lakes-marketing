## 🎬 Method 1: Screen Recording (Easiest)

### Step 1: Set Up Widget on Home Screen
1. Make sure your Victoria Lakes widget is on your home screen
2. Pick a lake with good data (e.g., Lake Eildon at 87%)
3. Clean up your home screen (hide other distracting widgets)

### Step 2: Record the Demo
1. **Start screen recording:**
   - Swipe down from top right (Control Center)
   - Tap the Record button (circle icon)
   - 3-second countdown starts

2. **Show the widget:**
   - Navigate to home screen
   - Tap the widget to show details
   - Swipe to show multiple lake widgets if you have them
   - Show the weekly trend indicator (rising/falling arrow)

3. **Stop recording:**
   - Tap the red status bar at top
   - Video saves to Photos

### Step 3: Edit in TikTok/Reels
1. Open TikTok or Instagram
2. Upload the screen recording
3. **Trim** to 30-45 seconds (just the good parts)
4. **Add text overlays:**
   - "22 Victorian Lakes"
   - "Live Water Levels"
   - "Weekly Trends"
5. **Add hook text at start:**
   - "Stop opening 5 websites to check water levels"
   - "POV: You check the lake before packing the boat"
6. **Add music:** Pick trending upbeat track
7. **Caption:** Use one from the generated scripts
8. **Add link** in bio pointing to https://dgtlgav.gumroad.com

## 🎬 Method 2: Hybrid (Screen Recording + Real Footage)

### Sequence:
1. **0-3 sec:** You at the lake/boat ramp (frustrated)
2. **3-15 sec:** Screen recording showing widget
3. **15-25 sec:** You smiling, boat loaded, heading out
4. **25-30 sec:** Widget screenshot with link CTA

This creates a story: Problem → Solution → Result

## 📱 Quick Tips

### Make it Engaging:
- ✅ Use trending sounds/music
- ✅ Text overlays (big, bold fonts)
- ✅ Fast cuts (don't linger too long)
- ✅ Show the "aha moment" (widget vs website comparison)

### Don't:
- ❌ Make it too long (under 45 sec is ideal)
- ❌ Over-explain (show, don't tell)
- ❌ Use boring music
- ❌ Forget the CTA ("Link in bio")

## 🎥 Batch Recording (Efficient Method)

Record 10 videos in one session:

1. **Record 5 screen recordings** showing different widgets/angles
2. **Record 5 B-roll clips** (you at lake, boat, fishing, etc.)
3. **Mix and match** in editing to create 10-20 different videos
4. **Add different hooks/text** for variety
5. **Schedule posting** over 2 weeks

**Time investment:** 30 minutes of recording = 2 weeks of content
